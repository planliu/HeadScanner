# HeadScanner
3D Head Scanner powered by Polycam and iPhone LiDAR technology, designed and built with a custom mechanical setup using two NEMA 23 stepper motors for precise rotation and panning. The project showcases skills in mechanical design, SolidWorks modeling, and additive manufacturing for face scanning applications.
